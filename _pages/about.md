I am a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Bioengineering at Rice University.
My postdoc mentor is [Oleg Igoshin](https://igoshin.rice.edu/). 

I received Ph.D. from [Department of Mathematical Sciences at KAIST](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/en/), where I conducted my research under the mentorship of [Jae Kyoung Kim](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~jaekkim/).

My research interest lies in analyzing biological systems by mathematical tools. So far, I have worked on mathematical modeling of circadian clocks, analyzing intracellular diffusion of proteins, optimizing immunotherapy, and causality detection in biological systems.

Although I am a mathematician by training, I have worked with many experimental biologists and doctors.
