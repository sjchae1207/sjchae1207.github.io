I am a postdoctoral associate in the [Department of Bioengineering at Rice University](https://bioengineering.rice.edu/).
My postdoc mentor is [Oleg Igoshin](https://igoshin.rice.edu/). 

I received Ph.D. from [Department of Mathematical Sciences at KAIST](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/en/), where I conducted my research under the mentorship of [Jae Kyoung Kim](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~jaekkim/).

My research interests lie in analyzing biological systems using mathematical tools, with a focus on spatiotemporal dynamics, AI-driven data analysis, circadian rhythms, immunotherapy modeling, and single-cell RNA sequencing.

Although I am a mathematician by training, I have extensive experience collaborating with experimental biologists and doctors.
