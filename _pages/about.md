I am a graduate student in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I am interested in mathematical modeling of circadian clocks, immunotherapy, and causality detection in biological systems.
My supervisor is Jae Kyoung Kim in KAIST and IBS Biomedical Mathematics group.
