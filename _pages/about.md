I am a graduate student in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). 

My research interest lies in analyzing biological systems by mathematical tools. So far, I have worked on mathematical modeling of circadian clocks, analyzing intracellular diffusion of proteins, optimizing immunotherapy, and causality detection in biological systems.

My supervisor is [Jae Kyoung Kim](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~jaekkim/) in KAIST and [IBS Biomedical Mathematics group](https://www.ibs.re.kr/bimag/).

Although I am mathematician by training, I have worked with many experimental biologists and doctors.
