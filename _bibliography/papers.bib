abstract = {The circadian (∼24h) clock is based on a negative-feedback loop centered around the PERIOD protein (PER), translated in the cytoplasm and then enters the nucleus to repress its own transcription at the right time of day. Such precise nucleus entry is mysterious because thousands of PER molecules transit through crowded cytoplasm and arrive at the perinucleus across several hours. To understand this, we developed a mathematical model describing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of PER as a single random time delay. We find that the spatially coordinated bistable phosphoswitch of PER, which triggers the phosphorylation of accumulated PER at the perinucleus, leads to the synchronous and precise nuclear entry of PER. This leads to robust circadian rhythms even when PER arrival times are heterogeneous and perturbed due to changes in cell crowdedness, cell size, and transcriptional activator levels. This shows how the circadian clock compensates for spatiotemporal noise.},

abstract = {All proteins are translated in the cytoplasm, yet many, including transcription factors, play vital roles in the nucleus. While previous research has concentrated on molecular motors for the transport of these proteins to the nucleus, recent observations reveal perinuclear accumulation even in the absence of an energy source, hinting at alternative mechanisms. Here, we propose that structural properties of the cellular environment, specifically the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), can promote molecular transport to the perinucleus without requiring additional energy expenditure. Specifically, physical interaction between proteins and the ER impedes their diffusion and leads to their accumulation near the nucleus. This result explains why larger proteins, more frequently interacting with the ER membrane, tend to accumulate at the perinucleus. Interestingly, such diffusion in a heterogeneous environment follows Chapman’s law rather than the popular Fick’s law. Our findings suggest a novel protein transport mechanism arising solely from characteristics of the intracellular environment.}

title={scLENS: data-driven signal detection for unbiased scRNA-seq data analysis},

volume={15},
number={1},
pages={3575},
abstract={High dimensionality and noise have limited the new biological insights that can be discovered in scRNA-seq data. While dimensionality reduction tools have been developed to extract biological signals from the data, they often require manual determination of signal dimension, introducing user bias. Furthermore, a common data preprocessing method, log normalization, can unintentionally distort signals in the data. Here, we develop scLENS, a dimensionality reduction tool that circumvents the long-standing issues of signal distortion and manual input. Specifically, we identify the primary cause of signal distortion during log normalization and effectively address it by uniformizing cell vector lengths with L2 normalization. Furthermore, we utilize random matrix theory-based noise filtering and a signal robustness test to enable data-driven determination of the threshold for signal dimensions. Our method outperforms 11 widely used dimensionality reduction tools and performs particularly well for challenging scRNA-seq datasets with high sparsity and variability. To facilitate the use of scLENS, we provide a user-friendly package that automates accurate signal detection of scRNA-seq data without manual time-consuming tuning.},
